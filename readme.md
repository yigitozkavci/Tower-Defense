<h3>Builds</h3>
<p>A Windows build of the game is ready in the Builds folder. (The build is ready, but not the game, keep in mind :V)</p>

<h3>How to play</h3>
<p>There's no tutorial in the game (yet). I have to explain what you can do right here:</p>
<h5>Keys</h5>
<ul>
	<li>B : Build mode.</li>
	<li>Q, W, E, R : Tower type change.
		<ul>
			<li>Q : Standard</li>
			<li>W : Fire</li>
			<li>E : Frost</li>
			<li>R : Lightning</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A, S : Tower projectile type change.
		<ul>
			<li>A : Standard. Slow firing, high damage projectiles.</li>
			<li>S : Laser. Fast ticking laser with low damage</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>In build mode, you can place towers by clicking where you want to place them if you have enough money for that tower. Gain money by killing enemies and clearing waves. That's all.</p>
This is an open-source tower defense game built with lua & love framework. 

Since I am not a pixel-art guy, most of the pixel images are found from the internet from their original disclaimers who I will be giving credits below.
